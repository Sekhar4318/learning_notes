Inbound-flow:

Watched folder ---ingested & stored-> State File collection -> Kafka Topic -> consuming service -> MongoDb  -> ME API




-> File comes into the inbound data lake watched folders then file will be pickedup and ingested into MongoDb(ProviderInboundData)(StateFileCollection)
-> Once it is inserted into StateFileCollection, published each individual file record as individual centEvent to a KafKa topic
-> We need to setUp routing rules to subscribe Kafka topic for published centEvents
-> MicroService listens for new event Topics
->Consuming service maps the data to the common model object and insert into DB
