Design Patterns:-
----------------

Factory method DP:
------------------

->Factory Design pattern says that define an interface or abstract class for creating an object but let subclass decide which class to instantiate

->In other words sub classes are responsible for creating instance of the class 

->It is also called as virtual constructor 


Advantages & Disadvantages
--------------------------

->Factory method allows subclasses to choose which class to instantiate
->It promotes loose coupling  by eliminating need to bind application specific classes into the code


Usage of desing pattern :
----------------------------
-> when a class doesn't know whta subclasses will be required to create
->when class wants that its sub classes specify the objects to be created 
->when parents classes choose creation objects to its sub classes 




Singletone Design Pattern:
---------------------------

->Singleton Pattern says that just"define a class that has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it".

->In other words, a class must ensure that only single instance should be created and single object can be used by all other classes.

There are two forms of singleton design pattern

->Early Instantiation: creation of instance at load time
->Lazy Instantiation: creation of instance when required.


Advantage of Singleton design pattern:-
----------------------------------------
Saves memory because object is not created at each request. Only single instance is reused again and again.

Usage of Singleton design pattern:-
-------------------------------------
Singleton pattern is mostly used in multi-threaded and database applications. It is used in logging, caching, thread pools, configuration settings etc.



How to create Singleton design pattern?
-----------------------------------------
To create the singleton class, we need to have static member of class, private constructor and static factory method.

=>Static member: It gets memory only once because of static, itcontains the instance of the Singleton class.
=>Private constructor: It will prevent to instantiate the Singleton class from outside the class.
=>Static factory method: This provides the global point of access to the Singleton object and returns the instance to the caller.
